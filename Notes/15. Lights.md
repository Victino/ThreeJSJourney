## AmbientLight
has 2 parameters:
color and intensity
this is omnidirectional lighting (from every angle)
![[Pasted image 20230404161034.png]]
like before you can do parameters later with ambientlight.color()
and ambientlight.intensity()

![[Pasted image 20230404161739.png]]

what we want is light from 1 certain direction like:
![[Pasted image 20230404161635.png]]

but lighting has to be done on every angle because light reflects in real life, we simply do light on every part, and add extra light from the direcion we want.


This can be done with 
## directionalLight

to change the orientation of the light we play with position.
By default rays come from above to down, when position is from the right side, the rays come from the right as well.


## hemisphereLight
![[Pasted image 20230404162232.png]]
blue from bottom and red on top.
![[Pasted image 20230404162258.png]]
every face is illuminated from this,this can be used fading colors.


## PointLight
![[Pasted image 20230404162453.png]]
for this the position should also be set
parameters: distance and fade
![[Pasted image 20230404162620.png]]
causes to fade at higher distances
can be used for example a lightbulb


## RectAreaLight

similar to pointlight but rectangle area, for instance a studio lamp
![[Pasted image 20230404163018.png]]

2 more parameters width and weight to increase size

![[Pasted image 20230404162918.png]]

you can do the .lookAt() to target to something


## SpotLight

![[Pasted image 20230404163431.png]]


has a circle shaped light
![[Pasted image 20230404163543.png]]

has parameters: color, intensity, distance, angle, penumbra, decay

angle is the size of the light, smaller or larger scale, can be mix and maxed with intensity for more accurate lighting, penumbra is the sharpness of the light around the edges

decay is the light fading the light away.

to rotate the SpotLight, we have to get a target.




Lights can cost a lot when it comes to performance
only as few lights as possible.

minimal cost lights:
- ambientlight
- hemisphereLight

moderate cost lights:
- DirectionalLight
- PointLight

high cost lights:
- SpotLight
- RectAreaLight


## Baking
You can "bake" lights into a texture

## Helpers
you can also use light helpers:
shows the light that comes of a certain light
