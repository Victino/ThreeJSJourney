transform objects have 4 properties
position, scale, rotation, quaternion

what is a quaternion, its a rotation... somewhat
all 3dObject inherited classes contain these properties

these properties will be compiled into a matrices

for position:
x is on x axis, y is on y axis, z is on z axis(back and forward) and

position is a vector3
normalize() reduce vector until length is 1
mesh.position.set(0.7, -0.6, 3).


axes helper


scale is also a vector3
scaling mesh/ objects

rotating a mesh/object can be done with rotation/quaternion..
updating one will update other aswell.
also has x y z axis
be careful with rotation because of order of rotation
you'd have to reorder() the object
