## Tone Mapping
The tone mapping intends to convert High Dynamic Range (HDR) values to Low Dynamic Range (LDR) values.

While we are indeed talking about the same HDR as for the environment map, tone mapping in Three.js will actually fake the process of converting LDR to HDR even if the colors arenâ€™t HDR resulting in a very realistic render.

To change the tone mapping, update the `toneMapping` property on the [WebGLRenderer](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer).

There are multiple possible values:

- `THREE.NoToneMapping` (default)
- `THREE.LinearToneMapping`
- `THREE.ReinhardToneMapping`
- `THREE.CineonToneMapping`
- `THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping`

## Antialiasing
![[007.jpg]]
```javascript
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
    canvas: canvas,
    antialias: true
})
```
turn antialias to true in the renderer to ensure these artifacts go away.
## Shadows
same as the lights discussed in lesson 15. by having directional lights and casting shadow you can add shadows.

```javascript
// Shadows
directionalLight.castShadow = true
gui.add(directionalLight, 'castShadow')
```
