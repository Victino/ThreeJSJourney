4 elements needed to get started with a scene
a scene, objects, a camera and a renderer.

objects:
primitive geometries    cube silider
imported models         create own models
particles
lights
etc

a Mesh is a combination of a geometry and material.

const is better for memory management

a camera has to be added to see the scene.
PerspectiveCamera has parameters for fov and aspect ratio
aspect ratio could be the full viewport?

a renderer is making a render, from the camera's view of the scene. This will be drawn on a canvas.
in the course, a webGL renderer is used.

position of the camera is also an object. has x y and z properties. increase z access makes us go backwards
