shadows are a challenge in 3d-rendering
we need realtime solutions for this

When you do a render, three.js renders each light that supports shadows.
The render simulates what the light sees if it was a camera.
They are stored in textures called ``Shadow Maps``. These are then projected on a geometry.

with this shadow map, it knows that the object's behind need to have a shadow.
