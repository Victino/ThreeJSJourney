shadows are a challenge in 3d-rendering
we need realtime solutions for this

When you do a render, three.js renders each light that supports shadows.
The render simulates what the light sees if it was a camera.
They are stored in textures called ``Shadow Maps``. These are then projected on a geometry.

with this shadow map, it knows that the object's behind need to have a shadow.

light.castShadow to cast schadows on objects
light.shadow.mapSize.width/height to increase quality of schadow

new.THREE.CameraHelper() gives the helper of the camera

you can improve the new with shadow.camera.near = improve location.
far is to the object it casts upon

## Amplitude
the size of the box above is the full render which is way more that our scene needs.

this improves the quality of the shadow because the objects within are bigger and it can give more detail

## Blur
with shadow.radius lower or higher,you can blur the shadow

you can put images as shadows, for this set a plane with the mapped image as the value for the shadow

this however is not dynamic so a moving object would not work
