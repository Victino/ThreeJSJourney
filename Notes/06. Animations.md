1.
Animations are renderes which you do every frame.
You can impact the amount of time an animation moves by
making them move according to delta time(current = date.now())

2.
Other solution would be clock.
clock calculates the time since start, and you can
move an objects according to the increasing elapsed time

another method is getDelta... don't use it.
getDelta gives weird results

3.
GSAP library adding to dependencies
gsap.to(mesh, {duration: value, delay: value, x/y/z: value})
