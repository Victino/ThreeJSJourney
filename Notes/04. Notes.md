Start of with saying current way of importing three.js has limitations
1-> only acces to core classes.
2-> when opening html file, your browser wont let you let javascript
execute any instructions for security reasons
wont read local files like textures or models.

solution: run it on a local server
this is done using build tools like webpack and vite

goes over node.js and npm, but already have that installed
runs vite
