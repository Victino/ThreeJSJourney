Geometries

Only used BoxGeometry up until now

a geometry consist of vertices.. punten in 3d
those are linked to create faces

for now, focus on creating triangles/faces
each vertex will have a position, uv coordinate, normal and everything else? color, random values, size of particles
Buffer geometry is used for storing own geometries

Float32Array
typed array can only store one datatype
has a fixed length
Much better for performance






BoxGeometry, basic box
PlaneGeometry, basic square plane
CircleGeometry, basic circle
ConeGeometry,
CylinderGeometry,
RingGeometry,   ring with enges
TorusGeometry, circle ring like
TorusKnotGeometry, knot like rope
DodecahedronGeometry,
OctaHedronGeometry,
TetrahedronGeometry,
IcosaHedronGeometry,
SphereGeometry,
ShapeGeometry, heart? curve
TubeGeometry,
ExtrudeGeometry,
LatheGeometry,
TextGeometry, allows written text
